## Commits

- All commits **must** follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. This includes the correct use of type, optional scope, and a concise description. Non-compliant commit messages will be rejected during commit linting.
- It is recommended to use tools like `commitizen` or `cz` to help format commit messages correctly.

## README 
- If architectural changes are made, they must be described in the README.md
- When making changes to the readme, also fill out the README-RU.md file in Russian
